        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chocolate cake with a molten chocolate center, topped with vanilla ice cream in a chocolate shell.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, cut into 8 pieces</li>
            <li>6 1/2 (1 oz) squares semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour four 6-ounce ramekins.</li>
            <li>Place chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine eggs and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. Mix in melted chocolate, cocoa powder, and flour until combined. Pour batter into the prepared ramekins and place on a baking tray.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the sides are set but the middle is still jiggly, 10 to 13 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
